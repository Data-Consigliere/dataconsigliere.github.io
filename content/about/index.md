Over the years, my work has spanned data architecture, analytics strategy, business intelligence, and performance management. I’ve always been driven by a simple idea: **clarity enables better decisions**. That principle has guided my entire career.

Today, I’m expanding that foundation into **hands‑on AI Engineering**, deepening my expertise in Python, machine learning, deep learning, LLMs, and the Microsoft AI ecosystem.<br>


**DataConsigliere** is my space to explore modern AI, Microsoft Fabric, Azure AI, and the craft of building intelligent systems with clarity and purpose.<br>


My goal is simple:  
Blend the wisdom of experience with the craft of modern AI engineering, and help others navigate this transformation with clarity and purpose.
