I'm José Bagina. I started working with data back when a "database" was just a file on a ZX Spectrum. Thirty years later, I'm still in the same line of work — the landscape just changed around me.

My path ran through hands-on Analytics and Business Intelligence in industries where decisions carry real weight: healthcare, banking, retail, manufacturing, hospitality and fashion. 

I've led teams, built architectures, and shaped transformation strategies. From writing code to running a 78-person practice. Both sides of the table. The kind of work where the output ends up in a boardroom decision, not a slide deck.

## The Transition

In 2025, I decided to get back to the terminal, expanding my foundations into hands‑on AI Engineering.

The center of gravity has shifted. Organizations need more than polished dashboards. They need reliable pipelines, architectures that hold under scale, and AI systems that add value without turning everything into a black box. I want to **understand that work from the inside — not just frame it from above**.

So I'm running two tracks in parallel.

**1. Le Wagon : [Data Science & AI Bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com/data-science-course)**

Four hundred hours of hands-on training: Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, MLOps and Generative AI. It's the most honest way I know to rebuild real foundations — code, friction, and projects that actually have to work.

**2. The Microsoft analytical ecosystem**

After work with Azure Synapse, Databricks, and Azure Data Factory lately, I'm taking that experience into Microsoft Fabric — the platform that brings those services together — and going deeper into Power BI from the engineering side, not just the reporting layer. This isn't starting over. It's moving what already works onto new ground.

## How I Work

Problem before stack. Simple, well-designed systems beat brilliant ones nobody can maintain. And data that isn't understood by the people making decisions isn't an asset — it's a liability.
